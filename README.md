## Code Snippet

Narissa - update function to edit if you visited an activity
```
editVisited: function(event){
            ...
            const id = event.target.id
            const test = this.favoriteActivities.find(x => x.id == `${id}`) // x stands for each object in the arrays. give us the object where the id is equal to for example 55
            let target = event.target.previousElementSibling //Looks in the event in the console. then you can get the value of elements surrounding the button

            if (target.value == ""){
                test.dateVisited = "Not Yet"
                this.visited = false
            } else {
                test.dateVisited = target.value
                this.visited = true
            }

            const updateVisit = {
                visited: this.visited
            }
            const res = fetch(`${URL}/favorites/${id}`,{
                method: "put",
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `bearer ${this.token}`,
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                    
                },
                body: JSON.stringify(updateVisit)
            })
        }
        },

```

Donovan:  making a ruby hash from Foursquare data
```rb
  ).parsed_response()['response']['groups'][0]['items'].map do |i|
    {
        name: i['venue']['name'],
        location: c,
        address: i['venue']['location']['formattedAddress'].join("\n")
```
Ebony: Using find for the first time and using the event object to access a sibling elements
```js
const id = event.target.id
            const test =this.favoriteActivities.find(x => x.id == `${id}`) // x stands for each object in the arrays. give us the object where the id is equal to for example 55
            let target = event.target.previousElementSibling //Looks in the event in the console. then you can get the value of elements surrounding the button

            if (target.value == ""){
                test.dateVisited = "Not Yet"
                this.visited = false
            } else {
                test.dateVisited = target.value
                this.visited = true
            }
```

## Issues and Resolutions

- Narissa: Update function

Issue: Couldn't figure out how to update only one date per activity. Once you clicked submit to update 1 date, it would go and update all the dates for all your favorite activites

Resolution: Using: `const id = event.target.id` and `const test = this.favoriteActivities.find(x => x.id == ${id})`. 
Since favoriteActivities is an array of objects, we used `.find` to query for the object's id and finding where it is equal to the variable called `id` (the id of the target). This query is stored a variable called `test` and is used later so that some functions will only run if this condition is true (recieved major help from Ebony!).

-Ebony
Issue: Our Mapbox couldnt function within the VueBox without additional libraries, which the documentation didn't really explain. The map needed information from the Vue instance for a fetch request.

Resolution:  After moving the mapbox, I was able to access the information by using `app._data` and make a fetch request with the authorization.
